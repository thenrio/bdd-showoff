# Introducing BDD

### As an example, when I was first getting to grips with TDD, I was pairing with an experienced agile coach, writing little test methods, then writing the code, and generally feeling good about life.

### Then I went ahead and wrote some code without a test.

### The coach, JR, asked me why I'd written the code. I answered: "we'll need it in a minute", to which JR replied __"yes, we might"__.

### By using the word __might__, he introduced the possibility that we __might not__. As it turned out, we didn't. - Dan North
